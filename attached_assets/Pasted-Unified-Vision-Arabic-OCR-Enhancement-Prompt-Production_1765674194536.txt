Unified Vision & Arabic OCR Enhancement Prompt (Production-Ready)

Role:
You are an autonomous senior AI engineer responsible for building a high-quality Arabic OCR vision pipeline for a production educational platform.

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Build an advanced Image → Text understanding pipeline that produces clean, readable, correct Arabic text, even when the source image contains glow effects, gradients, dark backgrounds, or distorted fonts.

This is NOT basic OCR.
This is a vision preprocessing + OCR + linguistic correction system.

👁️ PHASE 1 — MANDATORY IMAGE PREPROCESSING (BEFORE OCR)

Before running OCR, you MUST preprocess every image using the following pipeline in order:

Convert image to grayscale

Remove all colors, neon effects, and visual styling

Contrast enhancement

Make text stand out clearly from the background

Glow & gradient removal

Especially for dark or animated backgrounds

Adaptive thresholding

Convert image to clear black & white text

Noise removal

Remove dots, artifacts, and background grain

Deskew

Correct even minor text rotation or tilt

Smart resize

Enlarge small text while preserving aspect ratio

Morphological operations

Closing → reconnect broken Arabic letters

Opening → separate overly merged text

⚠️ OCR MUST NEVER be applied to the original image.
Only the processed image is allowed.

🔍 PHASE 2 — OCR (EXTRACTION ONLY)

Run OCR with the following strict rules:

Language: Arabic + English

OCR role: Text extraction only

Do NOT attempt understanding or explanation at this stage

The OCR output is expected to be raw and imperfect.

🧠 PHASE 3 — ARABIC OCR CORRECTION & NORMALIZATION (CRITICAL)

After OCR, send the extracted text to the LLM using the following instruction:

📌 Arabic OCR Correction Instruction

You are a language system specialized in correcting Arabic text extracted from OCR.

The text may contain:

Broken or corrupted characters (e.g. ��)

Misspelled words

Incorrect spacing

Joined or split words

Confusion between similar Arabic letters (ي/ى، ه/ة، ب/ت/ث، ل/ﻻ)

Your task:

Correct spelling and character errors only.

Rewrite the text in clear, correct Modern Standard Arabic.

Do NOT change the original meaning.

Do NOT add new information.

Preserve the original structure and intent.

Remove unreadable symbols or replace them contextually.

Output requirements:

Clean, readable Arabic text

Suitable for direct display to users or further analysis

Raw OCR text:

{{OCR_TEXT}}

🧱 SYSTEM RULES

Vision (preprocessing + OCR) and language understanding MUST remain separated

OCR extracts text only

The LLM corrects language only

No external paid vision APIs

Must be production-ready and stable

✅ EXPECTED RESULT

After this pipeline:

Arabic text is readable and professional

Broken characters are eliminated

OCR errors are significantly reduced

The system feels intelligent, not mechanical

🧠 FINAL NOTE

This pipeline is mandatory for any serious Arabic OCR system.
Skipping preprocessing or correction will result in poor quality output.

Implement accordingly.
