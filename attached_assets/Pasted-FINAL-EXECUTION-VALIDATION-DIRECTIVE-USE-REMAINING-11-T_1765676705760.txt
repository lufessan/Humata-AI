FINAL EXECUTION & VALIDATION DIRECTIVE (USE REMAINING 11%)

This is the final execution phase.
Do NOT assume completion until all items below are implemented, tested, and verified.

Do NOT add new features.
Only complete, harden, and validate what already exists.

🔴 1. GROQ_API_KEY — FINAL CHECK

Confirm GROQ_API_KEY is:

Required

Clearly validated on startup

If missing:

Show a clear, user-readable error

Do NOT crash silently

Confirm all AI features depend correctly on this key.

🔴 2. MOBILE DRAGGABLE FLOATING CONTROLS — FINAL HARDENING

The draggable mobile floating controls are implemented, but must now be finalized and hardened.

Required confirmations & adjustments:

Persistence

Save the floating control position using localStorage

Position must persist after:

Page reload

Tab close & reopen

Mobile-only enforcement

Dragging must be enabled ONLY on mobile viewports

Explicitly disable drag on:

Desktop

Tablets / large screens

Use reliable viewport detection (not assumptions)

UX safety

Dragging must NOT:

Trigger clicks

Block scrolling

Obscure critical content

Control must remain inside screen bounds at all times

Interaction quality

Smooth touch drag

Clear visual feedback while dragging

Snap safely within viewport limits

🔴 3. FULL SYSTEM VALIDATION (MANDATORY)

Before marking this task complete, you MUST personally test and verify:

👁️ Vision System

OCR on:

Image with dark background / glow

Scanned PDF

Confirm:

Preprocessing is applied

Arabic output is readable and clean

🧠 Brain System

Groq LLM responds correctly

Student mode:

Simplified explanations

Teacher mode:

Question generation works

📂 File Handling

Multi-file upload works

Smart merging produces one coherent text

No duplicated headers or broken sentences

📱 Mobile UX Testing

Test on:

Android

iOS

Verify:

Drag + scroll works smoothly

Floating controls behave correctly

No layout breakage

🔴 4. FINAL CHECKLIST (REQUIRED OUTPUT)

Before you stop, provide a final checklist confirming:

All features implemented ✔️

All features tested ✔️

No partial or placeholder logic ✔️

Mobile draggable controls fully validated ✔️

System is production-ready ✔️

Do NOT conclude with “it works”.
Conclude only with “verified and validated”.

🧠 FINAL INSTRUCTION

This is the last pass.
Use the remaining quota efficiently.
Finish cleanly and decisively.
